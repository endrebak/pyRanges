# Statistics: computing the Matthews correlation coeficcient between ranges

The Matthews correlation coefficient is a correlation coefficient that works
well when the classes of data are really imbalanced. For this reason it works
well when you want to compare the correlation between two ranges.

If you want to compute the MCC between two or more ranges, you can use
`pr.stat.mcc`. You need to give the chromosome sizes as a pyrange. You can get
these using pyranges_db.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.data.chipseq()
gr2 = pr.data.chipseq_background()
chromsizes = pr.data.chromsizes()
print(pr.stats.mcc([gr, gr2], labels="chip input".split(), genome=chromsizes, strand=True))
```
