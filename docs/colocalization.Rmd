# Statistics: colocalization and co-occurence measures

PyRanges can compute a normalized Jaccard-statistic (ranging from 0 to 1) to
compute the similarities between two ranges.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.data.chipseq()
gr2 = pr.data.chipseq_background()
print(gr.stats.jaccard(gr2, strandedness="same"))
```

To compute the similarities between two sets of ranges which do not necessarily
overlap much, we can use the relative distance function. It describes the
relative distances between each interval in one set and the two closest intervals
in another. Any deviance from a uniform distribution is an indication of spatial
correlation.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(gr.stats.relative_distance(gr2, strandedness="same"))
```

PyRanges also contains two methods (which are still in beta-mode) for computing
colocalization statistics: Forbes coefficient and the tetrachoric correlation:

```
print(gr.stats.tetrachoric(gr2, strandedness="same"))
print(gr.stats.forbes(gr2, strandedness="same"))
```

Please report any issues you encounter using them :)
